# [iBurn-Android](https://github.com/Burning-Man-Earth/iBurn-Android)

iBurn is an offline map and guide for the [Burning Man](http://www.burningman.com) art festival.
The 2014 release has been refactored for Android 4.0.3+ (API 15) with improvements to Map performance, (hopefully) common-sense design and a bunch of cleanup.
We use [Schematic](https://github.com/SimonVT/schematic) to generate SQLiteOpenHelper and ContentProvider boilerplate.
For mapping we've stuck with Google's Maps API after thoroughly evaluating the Mapbox Android SDK. Maybe next year (along with vector tiles?).

For users of iOS devices, we also developed a completely re-written version of [iBurn for iOS](https://github.com/Burning-Man-Earth/iBurn-iOS).

## Installation

* Make sure your Android SDK packages are up to date.
* `$ git clone https://github.com/Burning-Man-Earth/iBurn-Android --recursive`
* `$ cd ./iBurn-Android`
* `$ touch ./iBurn/src/main/java/com/gaiagps/iburn/SECRETS.java && open ./iBurn/src/main/java/com/gaiagps/iburn/SECRETS.java`
* Copy the following into SECRETS.java:

    ```java
    package com.gaiagps.iburn;

    public class SECRETS {

        public static final String HOCKEY_ID = "YOUR_HOCKEYAPP_ID";
        public static final String UNLOCK_CODE = "WHATEVER";

    }
    ```
* `$ git submodule init`
* `$ git submodule update`
* Add the following line to `local.properties`
   ```
   sdk.dir=$ANDROID_SDK$
   ```
* `$ ./gradlew assembleDebug` or from Android Studio invoke 'Import Project' and select the `./iBurn-Android` directory.

**Note**: Camp, Art and Event location data (`camps.json`, `art.json`, `events.json`) are embargoed by BMorg until the gates open each year. There isn't anything we can do about this until BMorg changes their policy. Sorry!

Fortunately, you can still run and test the app with the previous year's data.

## TODO

* On-Boarder
* When searching map, smooth zoom to frame results
* Pretty up that item detail view.
* Show Favorites on the Map
* Scroll back to top when switching sort
* Put Playa location as first item in detail view (e.g. 7:45 & E)
* Put distance as second item in detail view
* Put description as third item in detail view
* Make map view on detail screen slightly smaller
* Show Playa location below camp/art relation link on Events detail view
